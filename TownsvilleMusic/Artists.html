    <h1 id='a2'>Camerata</h1>
    <article >  Poms from Oz
The concept of the Camerata Singers originated in the 1980s when Susan Grinsell&#44;
who was teaching voice at James Cook University realised that ensemble singing was
sadly lacking for tertiary music students&#46; Since then&#44; Susan&#44; along with repetiteur
 Carol Dall&#8482;Osto&#44; has strived to bring quality ensemble singing to the wider community
  by performing at events from the Ingham Italian Festival through to Cotter&#8482;s Markets in the mall&#46;
The Camerata Singers comprises a group of trained singers&#44; both male and female&#44;
from age 18 and over who strive to provide quality performances in a range of styles
from classical through to A cappella and contemporary&#46; A number of members also regularly
 participate in local music theatre and theatre productions&#46;
